          <h2>About</h2>
          <div class="prose">
            <p>Hi—I'm YOUR_NAME, an editorial & graphic designer based in Washington, DC with over 20 years of experience leading communications and managing editorial design projects for global organizations.</p>
            <p>Most recently, I served as <strong>Senior Communications Manager & Managing Editor at Palladium: Make It Possible (2016–2025)</strong>, where I oversaw multi‑year global health and development publications, campaigns, and brand systems. Before that, I was <strong>Communications Manager/Managing Editor at FHI 360 (2012–2016)</strong> for the Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance Project, producing high‑profile nutrition and health reports. I also managed editorial workflows at <strong>JSI’s AIDSTAR‑One project (2010–2012)</strong> and earlier served as <strong>Communications Manager at the American Chemistry Council (2003–2010)</strong>, where I was Managing Editor for <em>American Chemistry</em> magazine.</p>
            <p>Across these roles, I’ve combined editorial judgment (clear narratives, accessible writing) with design systems (consistent grids, typography, data visualization) to deliver content that resonates with decision‑makers, funders, and the public.</p>
            <p class="help">Tools: Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Figma. Experienced with hybrid and remote collaboration across Washington, DC, Northern Virginia, and beyond.</p>
